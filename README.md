Project focus:
A) Styling multi-column layouts with the use of float. While I personally prefer flex-box, I decided to use float in this project in order to better understand how to edit older sites styled in float. 
B) Using the overflow propery to prevent elements from expanding beyond their containers
C) Responsive design 
D) Providng visual feedback to the user upon hovering over a button or link
